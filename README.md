## The Python tutorials
Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming.    

These tutorials do not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of Python’s most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the language’s flavor and style.    
 After reading it, you will be able to read and write Python modules and programs, and you will be ready to learn more about the various Python library modules described in The Python Standard Library.  

This implementation includes the tutorial of numpy, matplotlib, pandas, opencv, object detection.

#### Glossary

* **Tutorial 1: Numpy Basics**:     
This tutorial include some very simple exercises about numpy used in array ,some of them you can have many solutions to solve ,it helps you to get familiar with numpy.  

* **Tutorial 2 : Numpy Matrices** :     
After getting familiar with numpy array ,we start studying about numpy used in matrices.This part will show you some basic operations about numpy matrices, for example : get the sum, min, max of a matrix or many matrices.  

* **Tutorial 3 : Matplotlib** :     
By studying this part you can learn how to use matplotlib to draw many different Simple Plots, Subplots, Graphs, Pie Chart and 3D Plot.  

* **Tutorial 4 : Pandas** :    
This part includes quick start to pandas , the operations about table , rows, columns, items, and how to deal with files by using pandas, at the end it has some exercises for practicing .    


* **Tutorial 5 : OpenCv** :  
This part you can learn many skills about dealing with pictures, for example: read images, change the size, color and add filters. OpenCv provides a library which you can find many tools to edict images easily.

* **Tutorial 6 : Numpy used in AI** :   
This part is very important for machine learning ,it introduces convolution, pooling , padding and other functions for dealing with images, it's very important for machine learning.

* **Tutorial 7 : Object Detection** :  
Object detection is a computer technology related to computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital images and videos.You can start knowing about how it works and it's principle .
